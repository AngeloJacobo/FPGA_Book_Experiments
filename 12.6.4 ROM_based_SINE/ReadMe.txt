Inside the src folder are:
sine_func.v -> Uses synchronous ram(block ram) to store values of sine. Has 10-bit input resolution and 8-bit output resolution.
sine_func_TB.v -> See "sine_wave_output.png" for the result of this testbench.

Note: This code is for simulation-purpose only and is not yet synthesized to any FPGA.


TASK:
12.6.4 ROM-based sin(x) function

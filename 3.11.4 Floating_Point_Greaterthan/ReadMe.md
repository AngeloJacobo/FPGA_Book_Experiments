# Inside the src folder are:  
fp_greaterthan.v -> Compares two 13-bits and asserts gt if first input is greater than the second.  
fp_greaterthan_TB.v -> See "fp_greaterthan_TB_RESULT.txt" for the result of this testbench.

# TASK:  
**3.11.4 Floating-point greater-than circuit**  

A floating-point greater-than circuit compares two floating-point numbers and asserts output, gt, when the first number is larger than the second number.  
Assume that the two numbers are represented in the format discussed in Section 3.9.4.

1. Design the circuit and derive the code.

2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code.

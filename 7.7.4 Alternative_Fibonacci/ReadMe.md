# Inside the src folder are:  
* fibo.v -> Alternative coding style for fibonacci circuit by combining the blocking and non-blocking assignment in one always block  
* fibo_TB.v -> See "fibo_TB_RESULT.txt" for the result of this testbench.  

Note: This code is for simulation-purpose only and is not yet synthesized to any FPGA.

# TASK:  
**7.7.4 Alternative coding style for Fibonacci circuit**

Repeat the Fibonacci circuit discussed in Section 6.3.1 using the coding style discussed in
Section 7.2.

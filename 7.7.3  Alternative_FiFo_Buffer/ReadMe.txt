Inside the src folder are:
fifo.v -> Alternative coding style for FiFo by combining the blocking and non-blocking assignment in one always block
fifo_TB.v -> See "fifo_TB_RESULT.txt" for the result of this testbench.

Note: This code is for simulation-purpose only and is not yet synthesized to any FPGA.

TASK:
7.7.3 Alternative coding style for FIFO buffer

Rewrite the FIFO buffer in Listing 4.20 using the coding style discussed in Section 7.2.
Resynthesize the circuit and verify its operation.

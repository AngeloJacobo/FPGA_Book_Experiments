# Inside the src folder are:  
* dual_prioenc.v -> 12-bit prioity encoder which returns the first and second priority.  
* dual_pioenc_TB.v -> See "dual_pioenc_TB_RESULT.txt" for the result of this testbench

# TASK:  
**3.11.2 Dual-priority encoder**  

A dual-priority encoder returns the codes of the highest or second-highest priority requests.  
The input is a 12-bit req signal and the outputs are first and second, which are the 4-bit  
binary codes of the highest and second-highest priority requests, respectively.  

1. Design the circuit and derive the code.  

2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code

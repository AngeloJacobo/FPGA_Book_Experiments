# TASK:
**6.5.2 BCD-to-binary conversion circuit**

A BCD-to-binary conversion converts a BCD number to the equivalent binary representation.   
Assume that the input is an 8-bit signal in BCD format (i.e., two BCD digits) and the  
output is a 7-bit signal in binary representation. Follow the procedure in Section 6.3.3 to  
design a BCD-to-binary conversion circuit:  

1. Derive the conversion algorithm and ASMD chart.

2. Derive the HDL code based on the ASMD chart.

3. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code.
